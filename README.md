# Load-test-on-D.C-Shunt-Generator

## Aim:
To conduct load test on separately excited generators and to obtain the characteristics
## Apparatus Required:

## Fuse rating calculation for field and armature: 
### No load test  
10 % of rated current (full load current) 
### Load test  
125 % of rated current (full load current)

## Precautions
1. Motor side field rheostat should be kept at minimum resistance position.
2. Generator side field rheostat should be kept at maximum resistance position.
3. Starter should be in off position before switching on the supply.
4. The DPST switch must be kept open.
   
## Procedure for Load test:

1. Connections are given as per the circuit diagram
2. The prime mover is started with the help of three point starter and it is made to run at rated
speed when the generator is disconnected from the load by DPST switch 2.
3. By varying the generator field rheostat gradually, the rated voltage [Eg] is obtained.
4. The ammeter and voltmeter readings are observed at no load condition.
5. The ammeter and voltmeter readings are observed for different loads up to the rated current
by closing the DPST switch 2.
6. After tabulating all the readings the load is brought to its initial position.
7. The motor is switched off by using DPST switch 1 after bringing all the rheostats to
initial position

## Result:
Thus the Characteristics of DC Shunt Generators are analysed and load characteristics are verified.
